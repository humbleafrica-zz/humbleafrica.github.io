    User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project (UCFDMP)
    
    Hi there! Welcome to my code institute UCFDMP
    
    Project Requirements
    
    In this project, you’ll be building a frontend-only website using the technologies that you have learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development. You can either choose to use the example brief below or choose to use your idea for the website.
    CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND

    Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.
    The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
        Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
        Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
    The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
        Photos of the band members
        A video clip
        Audio clips
    Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
    
    In this project I have chosen to create my own scenario based on the scenario provided. My project will focus on an up and coming artist 
    I will build a static (front-end only) website for the artist.
    
    The artist has been around for about 5 years and has experience of performing live at numerous events in Ghana.
    
    I have taken the scenario of being given the following requirements for the project. 
    - His primary target audiences are his fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from is tours around Ghana, 
    as well as new material as it becomes available.
    - He would like to use the site to showcase his music and publicise his availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
    
    He has provided me, the developer, with the following assets that he would like to showcase on his website:
        - Photos
        - Video and Audio Clips
        - Also, he has social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
        
    I intend to use no wireframes but a configuration already existing in the code institute git hub libraries under:
    
        - UserCentricFrontendDevelopment-Resume/18-providing_a_cv_for_download/ see the link to the project below

    TECHNOLOGY USED
    
    The technologies used in this project are HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
        
        I could have uses JQuery however there were existing pieces of work done by other that works and suited the nature of my project.
        
        HTML was use for the structuring of the pages
        Bootstrap was use to ensure that the page appear a certain way on mobiles and another on tablets, desktops and laptops
        Javascript was used mainly for showing the mapping on the home page
        CSS was used to beautify the page and make the structure stand out with the different colours.
    
    I used the following libraries || link to libraries
    
    bootstrap || https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css 
    fontawesome || https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.5.0/css/all.css
    css libraries || https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.1.1/css/hover-min.css

    TESTING
    
    Mobile - I have accessed the site on my mobile as well as asked others in my household to access it on their mobiles and give me feedback. No errors were encounted.
    
    Tablet - I have accessed the site on my ipad with no issues recognised.
    
    Desktop - I have accessed the site on my desktop. No errors were encounted. I also tested using the element inspector and showed the various
    pages in the virtual devices build into my browser.
    
    Javascript - JavaScript was tested in console and jsfiddle (see image file in images photo of testing.jpg)
    
    The project appears well on a number of virtual screens therefore we can only rely on user feedback to make any improvements.
    
    The project was produced in cloud9
